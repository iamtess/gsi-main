                       	<p class="regularText">Launching Swell Info brings you to the main forecast screen providing a summary forecast for the morning and afternoon for each of the 7 days, conveniently color coded using green (clean), blue (fair), and red (choppy). You can swipe back and forth between your 5 favorite locations, and when you want the details, you can click on each day to get the detailed text surf forecast, tides, and hourly wind and swell data. The Swell Info app, also includes current wind, weather, tides, and buoy data, updated hourly at the top of each main forecast screen. This is the crucial information that notifies you on what the surfing conditions are right now – what the tide is doing, whether the sea breeze has kicked in, or if the new swell has started to show on the nearest buoy station.</p>
