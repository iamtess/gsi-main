						California USA, 2018 recipient.<br> My life is better when I surf because it feels natural and makes me feel free. When I catch a wave it brings out the 
best in me, where I am happy and stoked... It’s the only place I feel I can turn my mind and thoughts off. It truly relieves stress from school and makes me more calm...I can’t imagine living life without surf.

                        Life is better when I surf because I always have something to be excited about. I am homeschooled, so sometimes in the morning I can look forward to surfing before school.</p><p class="mb0">Life is better when I surf because I always have a reward for doing schoolwork. I like surfing in my life because I have something interesting to do that I can improve on, I can learn from my mistakes and this teaches me confidence, patience, and perseverance.

						NSW, Australia, 2018 recipient<br>
                        So many good things have come out of this scholarship for me, the best being the new the friends I’ve met! I now have 2 new boards for different surfing conditions and I’ve learnt there’s so much more to surfing than just catching waves. It’s about the journey, “the strategy” needed to get onto a wave; the practice, patience, commitment, timing, focus and the mental and physical engagement. I now know and care more about the environment and have a deeper understanding and respect for the ocean. For me it’s about taking on these lessons and applying them to my academic and everyday life.
