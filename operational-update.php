							<p class="regularText">For the past 18 years, Global Surf Industries has operated on a decentralized work from home basis. We use Cloud-based systems as well as 3rd Party Logistics warehouses located in transport hubs.</p>
</p>
							<p class="regularText">Logistics and transport have not been affected at the present time. All online orders are processed within a few hours of receipts and tracking information is sent to you once we get it from the warehouse.</p>
							
							<p class="regularText">GSI warehouses are fully operational with fresh inventory arriving every two weeks at the moment.</p>

							<p class="regularText">We understand your desire to surf or paddle during this time. We do ask you to keep social distancing up both in the water and out of it. Be kind to everyone around you. Show empathy for your fellow humans and please be your best self at all times.</p>
