						<p class="regularText">	1.	When you purchase a product or make enquiries about our products and services, via our Contact Us forms, we may collect your personal information including (but not limited to) name, contact details (such as address, email, phone number) and financial information such as your credit card information.

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes.

Most web browsers are set to accept tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons.

Consequently the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply. These tracking technologies allow us to monitor the items an individual may want to purchase as they move through the website, and to record how many people are using the different parts of our website. It is possible to set your browser to refuse tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons, however, this may limit your use of our website.</p></li>
