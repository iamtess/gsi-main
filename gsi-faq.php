                                            Surf, SUP and Paddle Equipment is pretty fragile and is made of fine materials. Wash it in freshwater after use and allow to dry in the shade or wipe down with a cloth. Never store your equipment in a vehicle on a hot day or leave it in direct sunlight for extended periods. Even small amounts of excessive heat can and will damage your equipment. We recommend that you always use a board cover to protect it from the elements.
