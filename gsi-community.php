							In November 2000, Alan and Pamela Skuse left their home on the Sunshine Coast of Australia, to volunteer at an orphanage in Tapachula for twelve months. The organisation they were assisting closed down after six months, leaving the Skuses with a life changing decision. To return to Australia, or take on the overwhelming challenge of caring for the remaining 7 children full time. The thought of leaving the kids, who would go back to the streets, and lives of abuse, was not an option. So despite the lack of resources and support, Pam and Alan decided to take on the huge responsibility of establishing their own refuge.<br>Get involved: <a class="regularLink" href="https://lovelifehope.com">lovelifehope.com</a></p>

                           <p class="regularText"><strong>DISABLED SURFERS ASSOCIATION</strong></p><p class="regularText">The Disabled Surfers Association was established in 1986 by Gary Blaschke after a motorcycle accident which caused him to lose a knee cap and spend a long time in rehabilitation. Gary quickly discovered that, over the years, many surfers with disabilities had been transformed into loners with no one to help them get back into the water. Thanks to Gary's insight and effort, now everyone from asthmatics to paraplegics can turn to the Disabled Surfers Association for friendship and support, and a great way to renew their interest in surfing. In recognition of the value of his 15-year contribution to the disabled surfers' cause, Gary recently was awarded the "Australian Sports Medal" and inducted into the "Surfing Hall of Fame".<br>Get involved: <a class="regularLink" href="https://disabledsurfers.org/">disabledsurfers.org</a></p>

Their mission is simple - they introduce disadvantaged youth to the exhilaration of surfing in order to broaden their life experiences through a healthy and non-competitive activity. Surfing can have a significant positive impact on self esteem, image, and confidence. Their program is simple - they have outgoing volunteers that bring their love and passion for surfing and dedicate their day to teaching it.
